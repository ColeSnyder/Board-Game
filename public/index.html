       <h4> The Game</h4>
       <ul>
         <li> There are 4 players. Players are named P1, P2, P3, and P4. The players are on three different machines.</li>
         <li> Each player is given set of 3 numbers chosen randomly – in the range [1 – 20].</li>
         <li>Each player knows their numbers – but must guess other players numbers.</li>
         <li>Players take turn in a cycle. During the turn the player adds a number to his/her set.</li>
         <li> There is a 4 by 4 grid of dots. These dots are red or green.</li>
        <li> A dot is green when the player represented in the row holds numbers that is a superset of number held by player represented by the column. Otherwise, the dot is red.</li>
       </ul>
      <h4> How the Game Works</h4>
       <ul>
        <li>A new game starts with numbers are randomly created and assigned players.</li> 
        <li> The board is updated after a player has played.</li>
        <li> A game ends with a winner when a player has all the dots green on their row. <ul>
          <li> The winner is assigned a point score – which is the numbers added during the game</li>
          <li> The other players are assigned 10 points.</li>
          <li>A new game is started.</li>
        </ul></li>
        <li> A match is a series of 10 games. The winner of the match is the player with the lowest number of points.</li>
        <li>If there is a tie in the number of points, then the player who wins the greatest number of games wins the match.</li>
        <li>  If there is still a tie – then there is no winner.</li>
       </ul>
